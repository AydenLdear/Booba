## Matrix Rain

# About
This is a cool red matrix rain thing where the rain will form a sentence in the middle.
Once the sentence is complete there will be another word.
You can customize the output by the code below.
You could use it as a loading thing and when the sentence is complete it will redirect.
# Features 
A red matrix rain that forms a sentence
# Edit
If you want a different output to what I have set then follow the steps below
On line 11 and 12 of `script2.js` there will be this code
```var MESSAGE = "Web Matrix rain"```
```var MESSAGE2 = "Martian#5562"```

You can customize it for a different output for example if you change line 37 to this code
var MESSAGE = "Awesome
The word that the rain will create is different."
If you change line 38 to this
var MESSAGE2 = "Autocode user "
Then at the very end it will say autocode user.
# Custom Redirect
In the code of `script.js` you can have a simple redirect option
To redirect on line 1 where there is this code
```setInterval("location.href = '#';",16000);```
You can change the # to any link you want so when the sentence is complete it will redirect you to https://examplelink.com.
Here is some example code
```setInterval()"location.href = 'https://autocode.com';",16000);```
# Bugs
There are barely any bugs apart from in the css part of index.html where you cant change the colour of the letters other ways just the first part of the line will be that colour.
